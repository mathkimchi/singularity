# singularity

## What is singularity?

Singularity is an app that runs and manages sub apps.
It should roughly do the same things as emacs, just in a different way.
Though singularity should have modular apps and ui that anyone can write, there are simple default apps and a ui.

Sub apps are managed in a tree-based heirarchy, because I believe that is a convinient way to organize most things (like file directories).
