## What is singularity?

Singularity is an organization tool for projects.
It aims to be the only app needed for all things productive on a computer.
To do this, it needs to be highly flexible and customizable, with the help of subapps.
Though subapps should be given freedom, singularity aims to outline best practices for subapps from the perspective of users.
