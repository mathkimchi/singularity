# Devlog

Things I want to log for my own remembering purposes.

## Initial Brainstorm

Inspirations (Things too look at for reference):
- Emacs and Vim for flexibility with subapps and extensions
- Tree-based organization
  - Sidebery Extension
    - Tree based browser tab organization, but slightly different from how I want it.
    - Nodes are tabs, but I want nodes to be more flexible (eg if on a page with sections, those sections would show up in the tree heirarchy) and nodes could have different relationships (not all nodes has its own window or ...)
  - The structure I want resembles processes more than the tab managers, where children nodes might be part of the parent processes
- Display standards
  - Direct pixel buffers
    - This is how apps tell OS's how to display
    - [VGA Terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_text_mode) work similarly, with 2 bytes per character, one byte for attributes (blink, 8 bg, 16 fg) and another byte for character (i think ascii)
    - Definitely do not want this
  - Html
    - Though I usually despise html, I am leaning towards a protocol closest to html right now.
    - The idea of window elements seems like it fits what I need the most.
    - I could have a finite list of allowed window elements
      - Most (if not all) would be rectangular
      - Eg: Plain text, div, button, ...
      - Though practical, I feel a philosophical distaste for this
  - Markdown
    - I like the minimalism of md for documents, but I need much more features for apps
- Rust Cargo and Nix for package management

Use Cases:
- Coding
  - Subapps:
    - Editor
    - File manager
    - Terminal
    - Browser
    - Task organizer
    - Brainstormer
    - Live viewer (for markup languages)
- Note Taking
  - Need to quickly write and organize and read notes
  - Idk, look into org mode and org roam
- General Organization
  - Calendar 
  - Tasks
  - Email
  - Time
- Music making
  - (feels like a whole can of worms I might not want to deal with)

TO REVIEW:
- Tagging
  - Archive
- Environments
  - Divide by project?
- How to deal with multiple screens?
- flexibility+accessibility
  - all core features and most features should be possible with:
    - only keyboard
    - terminal only ui
    - any os
    - audio only (idk, this is a stretch)
- Sync
  - Majority of syncing can be done through git and gh
- How to cope with HTML?
  - Even if this project gets a lot of users, and I create a display standard that can be a HTML replacement for web, I will need to access webpages that use HTML and will not directly support my heirarchy system.
  - I could just ignore that
  - I could give the user an easy way to manually split the html page to sections
    - With something like inspect element
    - Bloat might interfere with this
  - I could give custom extensions for famous webpages based off their api, or converting their html into something else
  - I could just directly support html
    - Probably will break on most complex websites
- Scripting language
  - Rust is a compiled language, how can I support runtime scripts and extensions
- Figure out how the following categories are different and their relations to each other
  - Global Data
  - Subapp Global Data
  - Subapp Instance Data
  - Frontend Data
  - Node
  - UI Element
  - App Instance
  - Environment
  - Window
  - Subapp
  - Tag
  - Project
- Reference Nodes
  - Analogous to symlinks
  - If multiple projects require the calendar, it would be beneficial to have multiple references to one instance calander app.
- Automatic Tree Organizer
  - Minimizes the total distance * frequency of switch of all pairs of two nodes
  - I probably wouldn't use this, but it could be fun
  - Speaking of this, what about cool telemetry (stored locally, opt in) for fun like those graphs in obsidian or smth
- Element
  - Elements are displayables that subapps can use to avoid rewriting code.
  - For example, the textbox element and tree view element
  - Having this also makes it easier to standardize subapps

Maybe the thing that I am looking for is a project management app.
One of the things I want to change is that I don't like the way apps are organized.
It feels ineffecient for some reason. The current organization is divided by:
desktops, then windows (where a window is a single app), then the app's own organization system.
If I am coding, I usually have multiple apps, at least an editor and a browser for a single project.
That means I have to constantly switch between multiple UIs and multiple windows.
When I close and open the project, I then have to reopen all the related things in two different systems.
Is this a really specific minor inconvenience? Yes, and I want to fix that.
I want singularity to set a system where all these different subapps can be organized within the same system.
A good rule of thumb for effecient organization is that things that I switch between often should be organized "close" to each other.

Ultimately apps are just friendly ways to display and modify data.
Its pretty obvious, but I just wanted to say it.
Every project will have corresponding data (not necessarily centralized)

Short-term Development Plan:
- I am just going to start by focusing on the bare minimum coding environment for a single project at a time
- Stick with TUI for now
  - Give subapps buffers from the ratatui library
    - Each cell or character has the following attributes:
      - symbol (the actual character), fg color, bg color, underline color, modifiers (which is a whole bunch of new stuff, go to ratatui::style::Modifier for options, use `|` to chain multiple), skip (idk what skip is)
  - No cursor management, if needed, modify attributes to manually emulate cursors
  - Need for proper gui feels more and more usefull
- Nodes in the tree are either empty (organizational groupers) or an individual window
  - I'm going to have the organization similar to the tree tab extensions
- Subapps to do:
  - [x] Editor
  - [x] File Manager
  - [ ] Terminal
    - skip for now
  - [ ] Task organizer
- Task system:
  - Just consider 1 file for now, no global, no references between projects, don't even care about the project directory as a whole.
  - store in a json file, edit and view with task organizer
  - [ ] Task
    - [ ] Head
    - [ ] Body
    - [ ] Check
  - [ ] Subtasks
- ui elements
  - textbox
  - tree view
  - Don't need a trait for elements (at least not right now)

Okay, I am at the very very early stage where I can barely say that the individual subapps (text editor, file manager, and task organizer) have enough features such that they can symbolize what they are supposed to be.
I have so many ways of improving them right now, but I know that I will always have ways to improve the details.
The thing I must do now is to work towards my vision of the bigger picture, and first determining what that even is.

Over the past few weeks, as I implemented these subapps, I had time to specify my abstract idea of an "all in one app."
The goal for singularity is to increase the user's productivity.
I've thought a lot about the principle of making things customizable if they can not be perfect.
The main feature that this aligns with this idea is allowing anyone to write subapps.
I want singularity to provide tools for subapps so that all subapps that use those tools to be standardized to some extent.
These tools will usually come in the form of abstraction, like abstracting the UI and organization.
The problem is that I can't consider every single use case, so I am going to start with mine.
My ideal version of singularity would allow me to use it for every single productive thing I can do on my computer.
These are (with overlap):
- coding projects
- note taking
- writing essays
- brainstorming ideas
- making music
- email management
- memory management
- event reminders
- task list
- homework
- small scale time management
- logging
- journaling
- organizing
- web browsing
- reading
- watching videos
- writing proofs
- searching for information (both online and on my system)

The organization system goes like this:
- every project has a specific corresponding project folder containing:
  - core file
    - its project id
    - subprojects
      - the subproject name/id
      - where to find it
    - subapps used
      - subapp name/id
      - where to find it
      - subapp settings
        - standard subapp settings
          - settings that are used by the manager rather than the subapp
          - these settings exist for all subapps
          - ex: their file permissions
        - subapp specific settings
      - NOTE: subapps and their settings are extended to subprojects unless specified otherwise
  - owned files called property for each subapp that requests it
- every subapp has:
  - subapp id
  - the runnable
    - haven't decided on what this is yet
  - dependencies
for a given user, their projects might look like this:
- project: root project (more like user configs)
  - meta:
    - standard: basic color pallete
    - code editor: format on save
  - diary subapp data:
    - I worked on cool coding project (link to cool coding project -> devlog subapp -> bugfix) today
  - children:
    - project: cool coding project
      - devlog subapp data:
        - bugfix
    - project: another coding project
      - meta: code editor: don't format on save
    - project: physics
      - children:
        - project: momentum notes
          - meta:
            - standard: tags: archived
        - project: collision notes
          - notes subapp data:
            - collision preserves momentum (link to momentum notes).

I guess a project file organization standard could be a whole different thing.
But I want to be as unintrusive as possible so people who don't use singularity won't be negatively affected because a project file organization standard does comply with this standard, and vice versa.
Having a single folder with all the singularity stuff would be the best way to do this I think, like a shell.nix file or a .vscode folder.
If people don't want the singularity stuff to bloat their project repository, they can .gitignore it.

Speaking of seperating the roles of singularity, these are the components that are needed to make it work:
- subapps
  - each subapp only talks directly to the manager
  - should not even directly access the filesystem (though I might not be able to force this)
  - but, the manager can then talk to the UI or another subapp or the file system on behalf of the subapp
- UI
  - displays from `SAVDR` (standard abstract visual display representation which is like HTML, should take care of **most** usecases)
  - turn user input into `user input events` and passes it to manager
- manager
  - this is what the core of singularity is; what connects all the components
  - takes care of subapps' permission for files
  - provides the proxy between subapp and ui
- file system
  - where long term data is stored

I am not sure how I will implement subapps to be modified at runtime.
It seems that I am looking for a method of [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) (inter-process comunication)
Here are some possibilities roughly ordered from ideal to horrible:
- dynamic library
- cli
- Manager-subapp communication via sockets
  - unix domain socket
  - still have to figure out initialization
- [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/book/start/index.html)
- shared memory
- message queue
  - i think this is similar to what `ManagerProxy` is doing
- wasm
- Custom language
  - please don't do this
Research:
- https://3tilley.github.io/posts/simple-ipc-ping-pong/
  - goes over many ways of ipc between rust
  - uses shared_memory crate for shared memory
  - uses Commands to spawn rust
- Search `crates.io` for ipc
  - d-bus is a linux tool for ipc
    - is pretty widely used
    - i think it uses servers
    - does not use sockets or shared memory
    - there seem to be people who hate it, but posts about why it is bad are also often met with ppl defending it
    - many crates for it, like `dbus` and `zbus`, both very famous
    - is probably not fast
  - `parity-tokio-ipc`
    - uses unix stream for unix and named pipe for windows so it is flexible
  - `interprocess`
    - idk, not that popular but has a lot of features
    - uses sockets and unix domain socket
- Search crates.io for shared memory
  - `rustix`
    - very popular, has many features, including shm. But, it doesn't focus much on shm and in fact seems to lack documentation.
    - Unless I plan on using its other features (which I might), a shm focused crate would be better
    - Has bad documentation
  - `shared_memory`
    - i mean it is called shared memory
    - needs `raw_sync` crate
    - hasn't been updated in a year
- https://users.rust-lang.org/t/shared-memory-for-interprocess-communication/92408/8
  - Use `pthread_mutex` from `libc` crate
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtVzlk4om6U
  - uses just the std library, std::process
  - Command to spawn
  - stdin, stdout, stderr pipes for communication
- manual shared memory implementation with no crates
  - it might not be too hard:
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66621363/can-you-cast-a-memory-address-as-a-usize-into-a-reference-with-a-lifetime
  - it will definitely be unsafe but i think i could make it work
- How x window system does client-server communication:
  - I realized that singularity is very similar to a window manager
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System_core_protocol
  - Wayland (which i use personally) has a [similar article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Wayland_core_interfaces) but it focuses on different things
  - overview section:
    - packets sent via network channel
    - Four types of packets: request (client requests server to do st or requests attributes like window size), reply (server respond to request), event (server informs client about relevant event), error (server tell client that request is invalid)
  - Graphic contexts and fonts:
    - `The client can request a number of graphic operations, such as clearing an area, copying an area into another, drawing points, lines, rectangles, and text. Beside clearing, all operations are possible on all drawables, both windows and pixmaps.`
    - this is pretty wild, i think this means that x window system clients do not get to directly manipulate a buffer, instead needing to request modifications
    - I feel like this would be super super slow, if videos and games are forced to go through this as well. I assume there are other ways to do it as well.
    - wait, i think that is what pixmaps are. I literally read the pixmaps section too, but i misinterpreted it
- Takeaways from Command and pipes attempt:
  - Feels unpredictable
For now, I am going to use Command to spawn and pipes to communicate.
If I need speed, I will look further into shared memory, but I just want it to work right now.
I assume pipes only lets strings or bytes through so I will use serde to send custom types.
In terms of organization, I am going to try turning the main logic stuff into a library and each subapp into their own package with binaries.
I think it is possible to let the manager and main logic have a library and a binary, but if not I will make manager a binary and the main logic a library.

This didn't work, new idea is to try using unix sockets with vanilla rust, but I am open to using rustix. Still spawning with Command.
I will start every message with a length of the actual message.

My ideas are still pretty broad, but I think I can make new progress based on what I wrote so far.
The next step is:
- [ ] implement project organization system
  - [x] (manually) make a test directory
  - [x] make project class and parser
  - [x] make project manager class
    - [x] each instance of project manager corresponds to exactly one project
  - [ ] get task organizer to work with project manager
    - [ ] add a way for subapps to talk to project manager (either replace `ManagerProxy` or make it better)
      - [x] split the subapps from singularity
  - [ ] add project heirarchy
  - [ ] add linking/referencing to task organizer

## Research

2024-09-06

I realized that my research on rust IPC was too specific, what I really care about is just runtime plugins in rust.
I think I saw [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/144zmwk/how_can_i_add_dynamic_loading_to_do_plugins_for/) already, but I looked through it again and found a tutorial on the very thing I am looking for.

Notes on [the tutorial on rust plugins](https://nullderef.com/series/rust-plugins/):
- Goes over a bunch of ways to do rust plugins
- Dynamic libraries
  - libloading is the main crate, even bevy uses it
- wasm is the other interesting option

I will try libloading, and this time, I will use branches so I don't mess up the main branch.

Speaking of branches, my current plan for branch organization is to follow [this convention](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534):
- `main` branch
  - should be thoroughly tested and stable (isn't right now), if someone wanted to use the most up-to-date version of singularity, they would use this
  - ie, this is the most recent stable release
- `dev` branch
  - tested, but not ready for users
- `feature/abc-xyz-0`
  - for new features

There are also bugfix, hotfix, and documentation branches, but I won't use them because it is just me.
In other words, all new branches will be in the form `feature/some-description`

I trust bevy, and its [code for dynamic loading](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.5.0/crates/bevy_dynamic_plugin/src/loader.rs) is extremely simple (just 25 lines), so I will try following it.

---

2024-09-07

Wait, NOOOO, bevy's dynamic plugin loading is deprecated and will be removed in the next version (0.15)!

You know what, I have had just about enough of the errors and dead-ends with dynamic plugins,
and in trying to do dynamic plugins, I learned that as long as I have a trait for plugins (in my case subapps),
then adding dynamic loaders for those won't require modifying the existing code much.
